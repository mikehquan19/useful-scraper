# Useful Scraper
This is a set of scrapers to fetch data from different pages about useful things like cars, apartments, houses, and job openings. 

They use Go and ChromeDP

I'm still working on them. What I've got so far: 
- Scrape data about house for sales from [Redfin](https://www.redfin.com/)
